You want a mobile app for parents to track their kid's Books and Words, with a specific navigation bar design and functionality. The app will have five tabs: Books, Words, Add, Play, and Profile, with Profile being the default home page. The \"Add\" button will trigger the native video recording function. You've also provided images for the navigation bar design.\n\nHere's the plan to implement this:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   Implement the bottom navigation bar with the design and colors specified in the images, including pressed and unpressed states with smooth animations. The order of the tabs should be Books, Words, Add, Play, and Profile.\n*   Create placeholder screens for Books, Words, Play, and Profile. These screens will initially only display the corresponding tab name at the top. The Profile screen should be the default landing page.\n*   Implement the \"Add\" button functionality to trigger the native video recording function.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:** Use the exact colors from the provided images for the navigation bar and other UI elements.\n*   **Typography:** Choose modern, clean fonts that complement the app's style.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  **Implement the Bottom Navigation Bar:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to create the bottom navigation bar.\n    *   Use the images provided to match the colors, layout, and alignment exactly.\n    *   Implement the pressed and unpressed states for each tab item with smooth animations.\n    *   Ensure the navigation bar is fixed at the bottom of the screen.\n    *   The order of the tabs should be Books, Words, Add, Play, and Profile.\n2.  **Create Placeholder Screens:**\n    *   In the `app/(tabs)` directory, create four files: `books.tsx`, `words.tsx`, `play.tsx`, and `profile.tsx`.\n    *   In each file, add a simple `View` component that displays the corresponding tab name (e.g., \"Books\" in `books.tsx`).\n    *   Set the `profile.tsx` screen as the default landing page.\n3.  **Implement the \"Add\" Button Functionality:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to handle the \"Add\" button press.\n    *   Implement the native video recording function when the \"Add\" button is pressed.\n4.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T03:22:40.131368"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create this mobile app for tracking kids' Books and Words with the exact navigation bar design from your images.
